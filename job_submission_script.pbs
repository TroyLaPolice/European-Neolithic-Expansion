    # final_statistics.log is file generated which collects errors, memory and time statistics and end of job message
    # process_monitor.log is file generated which collects and monitors the process as it is being run, outputs the current year etc

# NOTE: If the job ends with err code 9 it means that the program used too much RAM and was force killed as a result of the memory not being available

# NOTE: See as quoted from the SLiM Manual:
    # Defined constants can be of type logical, integer, float, or string; defining string constants
    # probably requires playing quoting games with your Un*x shell, such as:
    # slim -d "foo='bar'" test.txt
